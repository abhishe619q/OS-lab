# OS Lab Practicals: UNIX and C Programming

Welcome to my OS Lab Practicals repository! This repository contains solutions and implementations for various Operating System (OS) concepts, focusing on process management, CPU scheduling algorithms, and shell scripting. The practicals were completed as part of my OS lab exercises.

## Lab Practical Topics

### 1. **Basic Ubuntu Commands and `ls` Options**
   - Overview of essential commands in Ubuntu for navigating and managing the file system.
   - Explanation of the `ls` command with various options for listing files and directories.

### 2. **C Program Using Vi Editor**
   - Introduction to writing and editing C programs using the Vi editor.
   - Instructions on compiling and running C programs within the terminal.

### 3. **Process Management Commands of UNIX**
   - Key UNIX commands for managing and controlling processes:
     - `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `bg`, `fg`, and `jobs`.
   - Examples demonstrating process management in the terminal.

### 4. **Process Creation (Parent & Child)**
   - Demonstrates process creation in UNIX using the `fork()` system call.
   - A sample C program to illustrate the creation of parent-child processes.

### 5. **FCFS CPU Scheduling Algorithm**
   - Explanation and simulation of the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU scheduling algorithm.
   - C program to simulate scheduling processes based on FCFS.

### 6. **SJF CPU Scheduling Algorithm**
   - Description of the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm.
   - C program simulating process scheduling based on shortest burst time.

### 7. **Priority-Based CPU Scheduling Algorithm**
   - Overview of priority-based CPU scheduling.
   - A C program to demonstrate scheduling based on priority levels.

### 8. **Banker's Algorithm**
   - Explanation of the Banker's algorithm for resource allocation and deadlock avoidance.
   - C program implementing the Banker's algorithm.

### 9. **Basic Shell Commands and Shell Scripts**
   - Introduction to basic shell commands (`ls`, `cd`, `cp`, etc.) and shell scripting.
   - Practical examples of file management and process control using shell scripts.

### 10. **Shell Script Demonstrating if-else**
   - Example shell script showcasing conditional `if-else` statements for decision-making.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of **Unix/Linux** operating systems and their command-line interface (CLI).
- Understanding of **C programming language** concepts.
- Familiarity with **shell scripting**.
